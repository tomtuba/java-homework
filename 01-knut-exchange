In the wizarding world, currency is represented with three coins:
- Galleons (gold) are worth 17 Sickles
- Sickles (silver) are worth 29 Knuts
- Knuts (bronze) are the lowest denomination

Create a method called "exchangeKnuts" that takes a single int parameter, the number of knuts to convert.
This method will return a String, representing the coins given in exchange, in Galleons, Sickles and Knuts, 
revealing the smallest number of coins possible for the exchange.

To protect against theft, this method will return "Alert the Goblins!" if a negative number is presented.

Use the following to test your results:
- exchangeKnuts(659) will return "1 Galleon, 5 Sickles and 21 Knuts"
- exchangeKnuts(32) will return "1 Sickle and 3 Knuts"
- exchangeKnuts(0) will return "The bank is closing now"
- exchangeKnuts(-4) will return "Alert the Goblins!"

Hints:
Remember the modulo operator (%) will return the remainder after integer division (e.g. 7 % 3 == 1)
Dividing two integers will only return the whole number of a division (e.g. 7 / 3 == 2)
Use if-statements to make sure you are returning the correct values for singular or plural units, 
or if none of a certain denomination is needed.
